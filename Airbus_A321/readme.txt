Default Airbus panels with EIS2 ECAMs (Pratt&Whitney/IAE, GE/CFM and Rolls Royce Engine ECAMs for some 330s.)

Installation : Unzip the panel, you'd get panel folder. Make sure it's root folder for the files inside it (Airbus_A321). 
Too lazy to cabinet it so I just keep it folder'ed. You could backup your old cabinet somewhere else then replace the cabinet 
with "Airbus_A321" folder. it still works the same way.
additional font required for this panel : B612
