Default Airbus panels with EIS2 ECAMs (Pratt&Whitney/IAE, GE/CFM and Rolls Royce Engine ECAMs for some 330s.)

Installation : Unzip this thing, you'd get "Airbus_A321" folder. Make sure it's root folder for the files inside it (Airbus_A321). 
I'm Too lazy to cabinet it so I just keep it folder'ed. You could Unzip the "Airbus_A321.cab" (ill call it cabinet) then backup your cabinet somewhere else then replace the content
in "Airbus_A321" folder (extracted from cabinet) with things you got here. it still works the same way.
additional font required for this panel : B612
